# compound-words

There's an old story about a pen retailer that opened an online store,
"Pen Island", but didn't realize that the domain they got, penisland, 
could also be read as "penis land".

I wanted to see what other interesting compound words there are that
could be broken down in more than one ways.

### Sample Output

Here's an extract of the output it generates with the default values:

    ...
    remote-start, remotest-art
    topic-albums, topical-bums
    war-timescale, wartime-scale
    work-mankind, workman-kind
    wild-lifestyle, wildlife-style
    wood-entry, wooden-try
    work-shopkeeper, workshop-keeper
    ...
    There were 10456 doublets.
